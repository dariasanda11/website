## Description

This project aims to be a wearable device that detects when the user is sloughing using an MPU9250 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor. When bad posture is detected, the system provides alerts via vibrations, and an LED turns on so the users knows they should improve their posture.

## Motivation

I chose this project because I spent a lot of time sitting at a desk in school and at home, often without maintaining proper posture. Besides not being aesthetically pleasing, bad posture can lead to various back problems that could be prevented with regular reminders to sit up straight. Also, a key factor in my decision for this project is that it uses sensor interaction and LED/motor control, which are elements that I found in the labs.

## Architecture 
![Architecture](./imagine.webp)

- **MPU9250 Sensor**: It is used to detect the user's posture with the accelerometer and gyroscope that are connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W via I2C
- **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**:Acts as the central processing unit, interpreting signals from the MPU9250 sensor and controlling the other components
- **Vibration Motor and LED**: Used to alert the user and both are connected to the GPIO pins via a transistor for the motor and a resistor for the LED
- **Transistor**: Used to switch the motor on and off
- **Diode:**: Potects the circuit from back-voltage that could be generated when turning off the motor 
- **Resistors**: Used to limit the current where needed, such as for the LED and the base of the transistor
- Possible, not sure yet **Push Button**: Used for user input, such as to reset

## Log

### Week 5 - 11 May
I gathered and assembled all the necessary components for the device, carefully arranging and securing the cables to ensure they remained in place without excessive tension. However, because the wires were not quite long enough to reach their intended positions, I used tape to hold them securely. I then sewed the sensor and the motor onto a harness, allowing the device to be integrated into a wearable form.
